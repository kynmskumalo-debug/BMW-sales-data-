<h1>BMW dataset</h1>

Dataset contains columns with car details such as model, year, price, transmission, mileage, fue type, tax , mpg and engine size. This porject aims to create an analysis throug visualizations

<b>Price Distribution</b>

This visualizes how car proces are distributed accross the dataset.This helps identify if the data is skewed toward high or low proces.Most cars are priced at 

<b>Model Popularity</b>

This count how many listings each model has. This is useful for understanding which models dominate the dataset.The most listed models are 

<b>Year vs Price Trend</b>

Analyzes how avergae price changes by production year and shows depreciation or value retention over time. (The trend shows newer cars generally higher priceed eg)

<b>Mileage Impact on Price</b>

Check how mileage affects the cars resale price.We expect higher mileage to reduce price. The negative correlation between mileage and price

<b>Transmission comparion</b>

Compares avergae prices between manual and automatic cars. (Note which transmission type has higher median price)

<b>Fuel Type and Efficieny</b>

Identifies which fuel type offers the best avergae MPG.Diesiel usually has higher MPG than petrol 

<b>Enging size vs Price</b>

Test if larger engine sizes are associated with higher prices. Shows posotive correlation between engine size and price. 

<b>Correlation Heatmap</b>

Check correlation strength between numerical variables. Helps understand which features are most related to price(mention key correlations price positive related to year  or engine size)

<b>Depreciation Over Time</b>

Calculate the average price per year to estimate depreciation trends.Output shows decreasing prices as cars age.

<b>Fuel Effiecieny vs Engine Size</b>

Larger engines usually consume more fuel as they have lower MPG. Output note inverse relationship between engine size and mpg

<b>Tax vs Efficieny</b>

Check if higher tax rates are linked with less efficient cars.Output shows higher tax often for lower mpg cars. 

<b>Price Cluster using KMeans</b>

Using clustering to group by price, milease and engine size.Reveals market segments like budge, mid-range and premuim
